# Simple Shell Project.
- A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. 
- The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.
- Our project is to create programs that understand commands, to say the least.
